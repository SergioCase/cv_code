          Hi! My name is SÃ©rgio Carneiro, I am 23 years old and currently residing in London!<br/>
          I'm always trying to keep up with the latest tech-related news, ranging from Web development to Cyber-Security topics<br/>
          I have a particular interest in JavaScript frameworks such as VueJS (in which this "website" was made), NodeJS and Angular.<br/>
          I started developing in college when I started my Software Engineering course, which I finished in 3 years with a 16/20 average score.
          My first really big project was my end of course intership solo developing the full-stack of an Administration Portal for a startup, using AngularJS and NodeJS.
          I was happy to stay another two months after that working full-time to finish that project which is now in 
          <a href="https://admin.youbeep.com/login" target="_blank">production!</a><br/>
          I started working with ServiceNow at Euronext, where as a team of only 2 people, we were able to deliver an instance built from the ground up in just under 4 months.
          After that we maintained and expanded the instance and also our knowledge on the platform, delivering several integrations and new modules to the client.
          <br/>
          Starting 2018, I got the opportunity to move to London to join Crossfuze as a ServiceNow Technical Consultant and I couldn't refuse!`
